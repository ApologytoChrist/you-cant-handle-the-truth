### Dates

### Tasks

In this quiz, add tests to the wordCount function given in this repo for validation.

We have done plenty of practice for clean code and test driven development in the lecture. Here's a good chance to put it to a good use.

Your tests should cover various cases. Plenty enough to show the correctness of the code. 

It's okay to change the signature to add return values. But do not change the content of the wordCount function.

1. (20pt) In the PR description, describe your strategy for test this function, e.g. How are you designing it so it will show confidence that the code works.
2. (20pt) Make at least 5 commits as you work.
3. (50pt) Add at least 5 test cases.
4. (10pt) All test cases should pass. 
5. (10pt) Extra credit for finding any bug and proving with tests and fixes. 

Submission is similar to homework. File a pull request from your work branch towards your master branch, and make sure PR test runs. Send the PR in canvas.
